# PA 00

For this assignment, you will submit TWO files -- the readme and the script file. 


Edit this README file to include a brief biography of yourself. Your README should include the following elements:
# Hi! I'm Hailey!
I was born and raised in Oak Park, which is a suburb just west of the city of Chicago.
Even though I've lived in the area my whole life, I'm **brand new** to Hyde Park.

## Some things I like to do include:
- Read (I read 64 books last year!)
- Run
- Rock climb
- Go to concerts (my favorite venue in the city is Thalia Hall)
- Go to mountainous places and hike (***Montana is my happy place***)

### Here are a few pictures of my favorite places

* Images: add a picture (of yourself or something else) to your repo and embed it in your README
# My Git/GitHub Workflow
## My Experience with Markdown...
... is admittedly minimal. I looked up the syntax for all of the above formatting required for this task.

* A summary and reflection of the Git/GitHub workflow you adopted for this homework, and of your experience with Markdown (e.g., provide a summary of the workflow you adopted, and add some comments about something new you learned, something that surprised you, etc.)
