# Hi! I'm Hailey!
I was born and raised in Oak Park, which is a suburb just west of the city of Chicago.
Even though I've lived in the area my whole life, I'm **brand new** to Hyde Park.

## Some things I like to do include:
- Read (I read 64 books last year!)
- Run
- Rock climb
- Go to concerts (my favorite venue in the city is Thalia Hall)
- Go to mountainous places and hike (***Montana is my happy place***)

### Here are a few pictures of my favorite places

## My Git/GitHub Workflow...
... for this project involved forking the PA00 repository into my own branch, editing the documents in the branch in VS code,
and then committing and pushing those edits back to the branch in GitHub

## My Experience with Markdown...
... is admittedly minimal. I looked up the syntax for all of the above formatting required for this task.
I find Markdown to be very intuitive now that I know the syntax (ie. a different number of hashes to denote different 
header sizes)
